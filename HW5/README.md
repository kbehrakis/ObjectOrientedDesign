Program Description:
This program is a simple voting machine. Voters will state their top three choices, and the winner is found. The election officials are still deciding how to count the votes, so the system allows for different ways to determine the winner. In particular, one option that is implemented is finding the candidate with the most first place votes.  Another option is a formulaic approach: three points for each first-place vote, two points for each second-place vote, and one point for each third-place vote. Exceptions are implemented, such as when a voter tries to vote for the same person twice or when a vote is for someone who is not on the ballet.

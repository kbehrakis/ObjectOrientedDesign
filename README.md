# ObjectOrientedDesign
Object-Oriented Design Concepts, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Fall 2015

Course Objectives: 
CS2102 is an intermediate-level course on program design. CS1101/1102 focused on designing single-task programs for correct behavior. In CS2102, we begin to consider multi-task programs, more complex data, and other design goals—such as maintainability and scalability—without sacrificing correct program behavior. The course examines interactions between data structures, algorithms, invariants, and object-oriented code structure in the pursuit of good program design. All programming in the course is in Java, but the course does not assume prior Java experience. While the course covers certain issues specific to Java and object-oriented programming, the general principles apply broadly to most programming languages.

CS2102 is not an introductory programming course! The course assumes programming background at the depth of CS1101 (or CS1102). This includes working with tree-shaped data, programming recursively, and the test-first design process taught in 1101/2.
